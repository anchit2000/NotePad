# NotePad

I have used `pip install auto-py-to-exe` library to convert the python file to an executable application.

Right now, I think the application will only work in mac os but it can be run through source code directly.

I have the source code as well in case some one wants to refer to it and the functionalities that are added in it.

This application is made using `PyQt5` library. 

The source code is in `main.py` and for application, just go into `output folder` and double click on the `main.app` (not the folder).
